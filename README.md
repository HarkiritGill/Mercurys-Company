##Mercury's Company

Mercurys company is a mod developed by Harkirit Gill and are full of things I just thought were funny, little inside jokes and just things I think are cool.
I will update this as I learn more about creating my own mods and think of more that I want to do, right now its just figuring out how to do what I want to do.

So far what I have started with is; 
- The movement speed being increased
- Faster and longer Sprint
- increased stamina recovery
- Chief Keef as the ship intro
